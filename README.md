## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex


### What I learned

I learned using flex and managed to make my work much easier. I used flex, text-align, justify-content, align-items properties. Also, scaled an element to change it's size.


### Continued development
 
I should focus on using the right and useful tags in html, discovering new ways to style them in css.
